# Persian-Word-Finder-SQL-Powered-Dictionary-Search
I developed an SQL-based project that finds meaningful Persian words from given characters using a structured dictionary. The system queries and retrieves valid words efficiently with SQL string manipulation and pattern matching. Itâ€™s useful for linguistic research, word games, and language learning.
